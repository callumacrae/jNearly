# jNearly

A library and learning tool. Contains the features of jQuery, but written
using ES5, ES2015, and modern browser features.

Also will—soon—contain an annotated source so that people don't have to trawl
through github! :)

Contributions very welcome! Just send a pull request. I'd recommend opening an
issue before you start working on something, to avoid two people working on the
same thing.

## To contribute

To contribute, clone the repository and run `npm install` in the root
directory, which will install the necessary dependencies. Then run `gulp` and
it'll do everything else for you.

## Todo

- Write tests
- Write annotated docs generator
- Write code
